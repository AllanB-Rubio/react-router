# React Routes Navigation

## Description
This project is a simple React application that demonstrates basic navigation using React Router's `Routes` and `Route` components. It consists of a navigation bar (`Nav` component), a main content area (`MainContainer` component), and a footer (`Footer` component). Each component is linked to a specific route using React Router.


## Usage
- Click on the navigation links in the navbar to navigate between different routes (Blue, Red, Home).
- Click on the color links in the footer to navigate to routes with dynamic color parameters (e.g., `/footer/purple`).


## Notes
- This is a basic example to demonstrate routing in a React application using React Router.
